# Week 1

This is the Introduction page for the project.

> Based on your own experience, what do you think are some challenges to working with music and music-related data (perhaps related to access, curation, distribution, etc.)? How does your selected theme display some of these challenges? Describe the current manifestations of data relating to your selected theme, discussing how it is presently curated (collected and gathered) and how it is presented, described, and analysed.

A possible problem when working with musical data could be cross platform access. If various scholars are using differing platforms, this can also happens as technology develops and future scholars are using platforms one cannot imagine at this moment, musical data recorded in the current data may be lost or innaccessible on these other plaforms.

Specifically viewing the Yiddish Musical Archive, one problem when working with musical data could be reliance on physical data and those sources being destroyed. Yiddish is a language that was primarly spoken in Eastern European Jewish communities before the Second World War. However, after the destruction of Jewish communities in these areas, many of the written scores from this time will have been lost at the hands of the Nazis. The lack of documentation clearly stems from scholars and musicians of this time having no way to secure this data, aside from physically. This is the inherit weakness of phyisical data storage, is that it can be easily destroyed. 

This issue is the core reason for the exsistence of Brown Universities Yiddish Musical Archive, it is digital recordings of phyisical scores primarily written pre-WWII.
